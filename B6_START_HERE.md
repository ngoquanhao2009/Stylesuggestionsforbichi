## 🎓 THE STORY BEHIND THIS

This isn't just a map. It's a **carefully designed educational experience** that:

1. **Educates** through visualization
2. **Engages** through storytelling
3. **Empowers** through data clarity
4. **Enables** action through clear CTA

Every animation serves a purpose. Every color has meaning. Every interaction is intentional.

**Result:** Users don't just "see data." They understand the problem, feel the urgency, and want to help.
